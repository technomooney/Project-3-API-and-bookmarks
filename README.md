I got a key from NPS  base_url = 'https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1' 

this code provides a way to collect park data from the National Park Service API 
using the Park class and the park_data_collection function.

1: The code defines a class Park that has attributes representing different pieces of data about a national park,

2: This code can be tested by calling the park_data_collection function with different input parameters and examining the output.

- Separate the Park class and the park_data_collection function into their own modules, park.py and api.py, respectively.

- Create a test module, test_api.py, to test the api module's functions using the unittest module.

- Use a mocking library like unittest.mock to mock the response from the National Park Service API
