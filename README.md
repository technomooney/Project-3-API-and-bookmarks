I got a key from NPS  base_url = 'https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1' 

this code provides a way to collect park data from the National Park Service API 
using the Park class and the park_data_collection function.

In general, separating code into modules and classes can help make it more modular and easier to maintain. It can also make it easier to test individual components of the code, since they can be tested in isolation from the rest of the code.
